## Source: ProductLed - Ultimate Guide to Customer Acquisition Strategies for B2B SaaS

### Customer Acquisition Strategy Definition
**Customer acquisition strategy**: High-level plan that determines tactics and channels to attract the right customers to your business.

### 4 Essential Factors for Successful Customer Acquisition Strategy

#### Factor 1: LTV and CAC
**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Formula**:
LTV = Average Purchase Value × Average Number of Purchases × Average Customer Lifespan

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Formulas**:
- Simple: CAC = Marketing Costs / Customers Acquired
- Complex: CAC = (Marketing Costs + Wages + Software + Services + Overhead) / Customers Acquired

**Strategic Impact**: LTV and CAC dictate strategy by narrowing down viable channels and tactics
- Low LTV = Can't afford sales-heavy tactics, need product-led approaches
- High LTV = Can support more expensive acquisition methods

#### Factor 2: Ideal Customers
**Components**:
- **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**: Company characteristics (industry, size, revenue, budget)
- **Buyer Persona**: Individual user characteristics (goals, motivations, challenges, demographics)

**Key Requirements**:
- Know where ideal customers spend time (online/offline)
- Understand their challenges and pain points
- Guide them to "aha" moments for better retention

#### Factor 3: Long-Term Business Goals
**User Growth Focus**:
- Priority: Get as many new customers as possible
- Acceptable: Acquire customers at a loss (CAC > LTV temporarily)
- Typical for: Early-stage startups, venture-backed companies

**Profitability Focus**:
- Priority: Sustainable revenue growth and profitability
- Requirement: CAC must be optimized relative to LTV
- Typical for: Bootstrapped businesses, late-stage startups

#### Factor 4: Go-to-Market Strategy
**Product-Led vs. Sales-Led GTM strategies require different acquisition methods**
- Product-led: Lower CAC, self-service, product drives acquisition
- Sales-led: Higher CAC, human-driven sales process

### Common Acquisition Strategy Mistakes
- Jumping into testing channels without considering the 4 factors
- Spending on initiatives that don't produce results
- Using channels that attract customers at a loss
- Ignoring channels that could be better fits

### Key Success Metrics
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Customer retention rates
- Time to "aha" moment
